## Annual review questions

- [ ] What are you proud of this year
- I was able to research and put together the recommendation system really quickly
- I like that my AI knowledge from school/research is allowing me to understand the new AI innovations that are coming out and that I'm able to problem solve about how these things can be used in our process and in Fuzzy.

- [ ] What is great about our process
- I love how much communication and collaboration there is in the office
- Typing and validation everywhere is amazing
- I really like google cloud and firebase as our backend tech

- [ ] What would you like to learn or use
- Typescript
- My databases knowledge is pretty weak, so I'd like to learn more about those and the strengths and weaknesses of different kinds of databases
- I want to learn how to integrate AI more into the development process. I don't think we are using it to it's full potential right now.
- I'd love to get more experience with fine-tuning and training both OpenAI models and others

- [ ] How can we support you better
- Tasks and projects are hard to keep track of. Jira is helpful, but I feel like people don't really look at it and it's constantly out of date, not very detailed, or overcrowded with irrelevant tasks

- [ ] What tech is most interesting
- GPTs (duh)
- EV and green energy projects are really exciting
- I really love computer vision, so I would love to participate in some of the cool vision projects going on with bright.blue/bright.green

## SecretLab section

- [ ] What is awesome about your year: I love that you caught fire and made progress on your own. Love the new interfaces and the use of the new tools. You communicate well and do a wonderful job of reaching out to others.

- [ ] What accomplishments were standout: Working on developing the Fuzzy interface and understanding the consumer flow and experience.

- [ ] How can you grow:

- [ ] Notes for you: Want to see focus on learning the new tools. Remember Fuzzy is intended as much for your learning as it is to be a product. Letâ€™s focus on how that
